# Instructions to Run SQL Scripts

Right now, this runs locally on a MySQL workstation and is still in the design phase. After completion, the steps are as follows below;

1. First, create a new database called student_life and make sure you are using it.
2. Run the script that creates the tables. This will set up all the structures (users, courses, enrollments, assignments, grades, study sessions, and meetings).
3. Optionally, load the sample data script. This fills the tables with example records so you can test queries immediately.
4. Finally, run the queries script. This shows examples like upcoming assignments, weekly study time, grade calculations, and overdue assignments.
